      "articleText": "Can we overcome Learning Deficits in the Fragile States? The education of the younger generation plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of any nation. However, schools in fragile states face numerous educational challenges, with learning deficits being a prominent issue. Fragile states, characterized by environmental, economic, political, security, or societal instability, face significant obstacles that hinder learning processes, reduce school enrollments, and impair educational quality. Learning deficits manifest in various ways, including low literacy and numeracy skills, poor cognitive development, lack of critical thinking, inadequate social skills, and difficulties in coping with the curriculum. These deficits are exacerbated by systemic, pedagogical, and socio-economic factors prevalent in schools in fragile states. Inadequate training and low quality of teachers pose another major challenge. Insufficient investment in teacher training and development results in educators lacking the necessary skills to provide quality education. Without competent teachers, students struggle to develop foundational skills in literacy and numeracy, let alone more complex cognitive and socio-emotional skills required for success in the 21st century. In Somalia, less than 30 percent of teachers are trained. Many have only undergone short-term training of less than one month. Socio–economic factors also play a significant role in amplifying learning deficits. War, violence, or political unrest lead to school closures, displacement of teachers and students, and interrupted learning. Poverty forces many children into labor, preventing them from attending school. Gender disparities further hinder girls' education, depriving them of learning opportunities. Addressing learning deficits in fragile states requires a multi-pronged approach. First, investing in school infrastructure, providing necessary learning materials, and ensuring access to basic amenities.Improving the quality of teachers is crucial. Investing in comprehensive teacher training programs, offering competitive salaries to attract and retain quality educators, and establishing support systems for continuous professional development can attract qualified teachers.learning deficits in schools within fragile states pose significant barriers to achieving global educational equity and sustainable development. However, through systemic improvements, teacher training, socio-economic interventions, technological integration, and continuous assessment, it is possible to narrow these learning gaps. "

      "briefDescription": "I never let school get in the way of my education — Mark Twain . The current schooling system, as it exists today...",
      "articleText": "The current schooling system, as it exists today, is designed to reinforce the existing social structures and maintain the status quo. While education is a privilege that has brought positive changes to the world, schools often stifle creativity, enforce conformity, and hinder curiosity. Traditional schools are built around rigid subject divisions, fixed schedules, standardized testing, and rote learning. However, there are alternatives available, such as creative arts schools and Montessori education, which offer different approaches to learning. Sir Ken Robinson, in his famous TED Talk, argues that schools \"kill creativity\" by adopting a fast-food model of education that depletes our spirits and energies, much like fast food depletes our physical bodies. Many talented and creative individuals feel undervalued or stigmatized because their skills were not recognized or appreciated in the school system. Why have education systems become focused on conformity and reductive thinking? Are modern schools equipping students with the necessary knowledge and skills for the future, or are they merely perpetuating outdated industrial ideas? In a world facing complex problems, why are we still teaching skills that belong to the industrial age? Fortunately, there are alternative pedagogical approaches that prioritize experiential learning and individual participation. Problem-based learning, participatory-action research, inquiry-based learning, critical pedagogy, constructivist education, and phenomenon-based learning, which offers diverse ways to acquire knowledge and engage with the world. Finland's education system, for example, known for its excellence, widely adopts phenomenon-based learning.To redesign our education systems, it is essential to embrace a life-learning model, where experiences are central to the learning process. Schools should be places of exploration, experimentation, and community development, focusing not only on academic skills but also on life skills. Ultimately, education should be a universal experience that prepares individuals to become valuable contributors to society. If we fail to change our approach to education and continue to prepare young people in the same way, we will perpetuate the problems we face today. Linear and reductive thinking will persist, as we continue to produce thinkers who created those problems in the first place. To create a better future, we must re - design our education systems to nurture multidimensional systems thinkers and empowers them to solve the complex challenges the World faces today."

       "articleText": "In Kenya, the introduction of the 8:4:4 educational system almost four decades ago faced criticism due to its overwhelming number of subjects and high cost of education. In response, the Ministry of Education embarked on a mission to reduce the number of subjects and streamline content. However, with the introduction of the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) in 2017, similar issues have resurfaced, impacting the well-being and development of students. The CBC system consists of 14 subjects at the junior secondary level, taken by 11- and 12-year-old learners who transitioned from grade six. In addition, the system places a heavy emphasis on formative assessment, accounting for 60 percent of the end-of-primary education examination. This increased focus on assessment and extracurricular activities has added to the overall burden on students, leading to stress, anxiety, and burnout. The negative consequences of curriculum overload are significant. The constant juggling of multiple subjects and exams leaves little time for deep engagement and critical analysis, hindering the development of a genuine passion for learning. Students may only acquire a superficial understanding of the material, resulting in a lack of long-term retention. Moreover, the rigid adherence to a fixed syllabus restricts students' exploration of their interests and hampers the development of crucial skills like problem-solving, critical thinking, and innovation.Addressing Challenges of curriculum overload ·      Streamlining the Curriculum: Shift towards core subjects and essential skills. By trimming excessive content and concentrating on fundamental concepts, students can experience a more meaningful and in-depth learning experience. ·      Integration of Critical Skills: Emphasis on critical skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration. ·      Flexible Curriculum Design: Allow for customization and flexibility of curriculum Framework. This will empower students to pursue their interests while maintaining a solid foundation in essential subjects.  ·      Integration of Cross-Disciplinary Themes: Incorporate interdisciplinary projects that connect various subjects to promotes holistic learning and the application of knowledge. ·      Focus on Skills, not just Content: Shifting emphasis from content mastery alone to the development of critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and communication skills is crucial. While the initial dream for a competency – based curriculum was great, the design of the curriculum and the implementation mechanism on the ground goes against the spirit of the dream. The MoE must take proactive measures to streamline the curriculum, prioritize flexibility and personalization, and integrate critical skills. "

      "articleText": "Dear Colleagues, as we proceed in our exploration of curriculum Implementation, this discussion will centre on the critical role of clear learning outcomes. With the progression towards student-centered education, emphasizing clear \"learning outcomes\" becomes essential. These are the primary skills, knowledge, and attitudes that we, as educators, wish our students to cultivate. These outcomes define the end goals of the educational journey and play a significant role in shaping our teaching strategies.Learning outcomes refer to the specific knowledge or skills we aim for students to acquire by the conclusion of a course or study period. They outline what students should know, comprehend, and be capable of performing. Generally, these outcomes are categorized into three areas: knowledge (understanding of theories and facts), skills (ability to use this knowledge in practical situations such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication), and attitudes (values and behaviors like teamwork and resilience).The definition of clear learning outcomes is crucial for numerous reasons. Firstly, it provides guidance in the development and delivery of course material, shaping the selection of content, pedagogical methods, resources, the pace, and the sequence of instruction. Without well-defined outcomes, creating a pertinent, organized curriculum that aligns with students' needs could prove challenging. These goals also provide a basis for evaluating student progress. They enable us to develop assessment methods that directly measure the attainment of these objectives. For example, if a goal is to enhance students' critical thinking skills, teachers can design tasks requiring learners to analyze, evaluate, and create.In an educational environment where schools are increasingly expected to demonstrate the effectiveness of their teaching, clear learning outcomes provide a means to showcase this effectiveness. They assist in communicating the institution's objectives to all stakeholders. When these outcomes are shared with students, they offer clarity on what is expected of them, promoting student autonomy. This helps students to take responsibility for their learning, set their own goals, and track their progress.The process of defining clear learning outcomes is a fundamental aspect of curriculum delivery. It ensures teaching is purposeful and relevant, provides a means to assess student progress, aids in demonstrating institutional accountability, and encourages students to take control of their learning. As such, educators and curriculum developers must invest time and effort in determining and articulating these outcomes to ensure effective learning. Thank You!"
